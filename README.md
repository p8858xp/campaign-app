# Postscript Frontend Take-Home Assignment

One of the most common SMS/MMS marketing concepts is that of the _campaign_, a message sent to all of an organization's subscribers or a subset based on demographics. For this take-home assignment, you will create a simplified dashboard for viewing, editing, and managing campaigns similar to the one we use at Postscript.

If you'd like to see a fully featured dashboard in action, you can create a free trial Shopify account and install Postscript on the [Shopify Store](https://apps.shopify.com/postscript-sms-marketing). Our campaign section is under `Campaigns`, and for inspiration on how to handle filters visit `Segments` or `Automations`.

## What We're Looking For

Technically speaking, your dashboard should demonstrate your skills by using all of the following techniques and technologies:

* Create the dashboard using React and any bundler/bootstrapping tool of your choice (`create-react-app`, Weback, Rollup, Gatsby, etc.). You must support or use ES6 syntax, and React **is required.**
* Style your dashboard any way you like; get creative with plain CSS, a UI toolkit for React, or anything else.
* Clean and idiomatic state management in your application (higher order components, prop drilling, Context API, or Mobx/Redux).
* Document your thought process with a short write-up explaining how you tackled the project.

You do not need to deploy or upload your application to the Internet. However, please be sure we can run it locally (a `package.json` file with all requirements, a docker container, etc.) so we can see your work in action!

We also have the following "soft skills" and requirements that will be taken into account:

* Demonstration of the 80/20 rule: Accomplish your task with 80% of the "polish" by using 20% of the effort it would take to "polish" completely.
* Creative, value oriented thinking. Have a great idea for editing campaigns? Add it.
* Decision making in a new feature. The dashboard is deliberately underspecified to give you the opportunity to create a fantastic feature with your perspective.

Please take **no longer than four hours** for the assignment. If you can create a minimally viable version of the dashboard in less time, that can give you an advantage. Creating an OK version in an hour is more impressive than a good version in four hours.

Our evaluation of the homework is holistic and you will not be disqualified for missing a specific requirement. We want to understand how you approach a problem, your technical abilities on the frontend, and what you choose to prioritize. If you have questions please reach out, but we encourage you to trust you gut and show us what you can do in a limited timeframe with limited information.

## Using The Placeholder Data

In the `data/` directory is an included JSON file with two object types: campaigns and segments. Use this data (along with mock data you need) to create your application.

```json
{
    "campaigns": [
        {...snip},
    ],
    "segments": [
        {...snip},
    ],
}
```

## User Stories

* I can view a list of my `Preview` (unsent) campaigns and their target segments.
* I can view a list of my `Sent` campaigns and their performance `stats` (amount sent, click through rates).
* I can create a new campaign or edit a `Preview` campaign.
    * There is a live preview of my campaign as I edit it.
    * I can add/edit a `media` link in my campaign to attach a picture or GIF to the message.
    * My created campaign can use _tags_ to replace parts of the message with variables.
    * Tags required for this demo are `{shop_link}`, `{first_name}`, and `{shop_name}`
    * Select a target segment for campaign
    * You may add support for additional tags (custom links, personalized offers, etc.)!
