I built this project using only functional components with React hooks because it allowed me to write cleaner 
code with fewer lines. I decided to implement the context api because I noticed I was passing the same props 
down continuously to many components at different levels of nesting. It reduces complexity and allow me to easily
access my campaigns data(from the given json file) which I needed in many of my components and share data across 
my application. I also decided to create 2 components - 1 responsible for editing a campaign and the other for 
creating a new campaign. In both of these components I used the campaignForm component to decide which form to 
display based on whether or not the campaign prop was passed down to this component. I also used React Router to 
create different paths for different components and by using this library, I improved the application speed, reduced
server calls, and created a seamless experience for ths user. I lastly used Jest and Enzyme to write unit tests
for my components, mainly the CampaignForm component because that is the component with the most logic/complexity.
